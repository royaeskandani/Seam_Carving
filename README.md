# Seam Carving

This is a Python project that implements the Seam Carving algorithm to resize images. Seam carving allows images to be dynamically reduced or enlarged by adding or removing seams through the image. This technique ensures that important structures and details are preserved while the aspect ratio of the image is adjusted.

**Algorithm**
- Image reduction: Reduce the size of images by removing seams.
- Image enlargement (in progress): Add seams to increase the size of images.

Implemented in Jupiter Notebook and illustrated with examples.
